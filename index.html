                    SheCodesTulsa is a meetup for women in tech to come together. We invite people who are looking to start a career in coding, those seeking to increase their skills, and people wanting support women in technology. We will have two meetups a month. One will be a study night to work together on projects or help those learning a new language. Throw a comment in the study night meetups to let us know what you'll be working on. The other will cover various topics and programming languages. At the end, your feedback will be collected to help us all become better presenters and to gauge interest in topics.
